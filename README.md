This project aims to develop a web application using Java Spring Boot and a chosen database. The application will have the following features:

1. Create Vendor: Users can enter details such as Vendor Name, Bank Account No., Bank Name, Address Line 1, Address Line 2, City, Country, and Zip Code to create a new vendor. The fields marked with (*) are mandatory.

2. Display Paginated List of Vendors: The application will display a paginated list of vendors, showing their Vendor Name, Bank Account No., Bank Name, and options to edit or delete each vendor.

3. Edit Vendor: Users can edit the details of a vendor by loading the vendor's information on the edit vendor screen. After making the necessary changes, they can submit the form to update the vendor's details.

4. Delete Vendor: Users will have the option to delete a vendor after confirming their action. Once deleted, the vendor will be permanently removed from the system.

The web application will provide a user-friendly interface for managing vendor information, ensuring the mandatory fields are filled, and offering convenient options for editing and deleting vendors.
